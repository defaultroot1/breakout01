# breakout01

A simple clone of Breakout to learn C#/MonoGame.

This got very messy at the end when I tried to implement a GameManager class to control game states (Playing, Paused, GameOver etc.). The methods to determine bounce direction after the ball hits a block is a bit weird at times as well. 

Otherwise I'm happy enough with the code and design.
