# breakout01

A simple clone of Breakout to learn C#/MonoGame.

This got messy at the end when I tried to implement game states (Playing, GameOver). Would be better implemented in some kind of GameManager I think.

The results of bounce direction after the ball hits a block can be a bit mental too, but otherwise I'm happy enough with the code and design for a 2nd game.
